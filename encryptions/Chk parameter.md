#### Data for the chk
For level downloading: levelID, inc, RS value, accountID, UDID, UUID  
  
For level uploading: seed  
  
For level comments: username, comment, levelID, percentage, comment Type (0 = Level, 1 = User)  
  
For quests and chest rewards: 2 random numbers  
  
For liking: special, itemID, like, type, RS, accountID, UDID, UUID  
  
For rating: levelID, stars, RS, accountID, UDID, UUID  
  
For updating user scores: accountID, userCoins, demons, stars, coins, icon type, icon, diamonds, account icon, account ship, account ball, account UFO, account wave, account robot, account glow, account spider, account explosion  
  
For update the level user highscore: accountID, levelID, percentage, seconds, jumps, attempts, seed, bests differences, UNKNOWN (always 1), user coins, dailyID, seed7 ("s7" from packet) `Seconds = seconds taken to reach the best, Jumps = jumps taken to reach the best, Bests Differences = differences between bests, ex: 0% - 65% - 100% -> (65 - 0), (100 - 65) -> 65,35`
